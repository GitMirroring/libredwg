According to the DWG technical specs this data is 8 bytes in size. Below is an extract from the spec.\n\n5 (1005) An entity handle reference. The value is given as 8 bytes -- even if the leading ones are 0. It's not a string; read it as hex, as usual for handles. (There's no length specifier this time.)\n\nSee attached file with an MTEXT entity that fails due to this.\n\n[test-abcde.zip](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg/files/3349896/test-abcde.zip)","files":null}]}
