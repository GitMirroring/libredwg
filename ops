I would like to request a tool to clean dwg files taking this measures:\n1- Remove the thumbnails.\n2- replace long path with related path.\n3- zerofy embedded GUID.\n4- Purge unused items.\n5- optimize repeated shapes like \"blockify\" tool in bricscad.\n6- optimize embedded files (like wmf, word,..etc) for size and add option to extract them.\n7- optimize compressed streams for size. \n\nThis is what i have in mind and i hope this is hopeful.\n\nCan this be made for DWF format too. We've managed to reduce its size through \"Fileoptimizer\" and \"Leanify\".\n\nRegards","files":null}]}
