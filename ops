In [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle) it is optional either way :)\n\nI'd really like to get involved and contribute, but my C is currently quite poor. I understand the `fseek` in the `NOCOMMA` macro, but specifically I lack understanding of debugging. What do you suggest is the best way I can debug why this isn't working? Is strace the best way or is there a better way? How can I make use of the LOG_##logtype macros, and how and where are those logs saved? I've checked out the CONTRIBUTING and HACKING files but couldn't work it out.\n\nThank you so much for keeping this project going, I can't wait to get hacking properly!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"b57a4f5420adf835b8b83469143e813bd4f12c78"},"timestamp":1585168922,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDA3NjM5Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg/issues/75#issuecomment-604076392"},"message":"Fixed with dca476cf4c7fb7b3a24e362db8f3548712387916","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"b57a4f5420adf835b8b83469143e813bd4f12c78"},"timestamp":1585168922,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE2NTY5MzkxMw=="},"status":2}]}
