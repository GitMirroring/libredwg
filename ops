The text content is well preserved when exporting, but all the characters are replaced with truetype fonts. So after dwg is converted into svg, many style changes have occurred. Can it still be shx font style restore?\ntmp2.dwg contains a small amount of drawing content, but after switching out to svg, it does not see any content. I tried to use dwg2dxf to convert to dxf. At this time, I get the following error message.\n![QQ截图20191015223202](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10000818/66841212-eefc6b00-ef9b-11e9-8955-3645a6269d7f.png)\n[libredwg test.zip](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg/files/3729861/libredwg.test.zip)\nThanks.","files":null}]}
