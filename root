It might not be perfect and I've only tested it under FreeBSD (`#include \u003csys/endian.h\u003e`), so some adjustments are most certainly in order for GNU/Linux and other systems, but it seems to fix R2004 decoding and allow to pass those tests.  Patch for R2007 decoder would follow.","files":null}]}
