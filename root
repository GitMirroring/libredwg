From the DWG technical specification it looks like the handle does not follow the color flags and index. Below is an extract from the spec:\n\n0x4000: has AcDbColor reference (0x8000 is also set in this case).\nThe handle to the color is written in the handle stream.\n\nIt says that the handle is written in the handle stream, not that it follows...\n\nSee attached file with a LWPOLYLINE with color handle\n\n[polyline test.zip](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg/files/3349904/polyline.test.zip)","files":null}]}
